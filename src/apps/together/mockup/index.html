        <strong><h1>Playlist Me</h1></strong>

        <h4>Collaboratively Created Playlists</h4>
        <p>Whether it is a playlist for a classy event, bad breakup, or solo dance party Playlist Me will help you get in the mood! Join and request other users help you make a playlist and help others make their own playlist. All you need is some songs to suggest and a little creativity to give and recieve great playlists for any occasion.</p>

        <h4>Details</h4>
        <p>This app is ideal for about 20 people to collaborate to come up with a great playlist. This app is a practical way to get some advice on new music or new combinations of music from other people. The only thing required is that users help collaborate to make playlists if they want to recieve help making their own playlist. Users will be given a trial of 3 playlists that can be made without contributing to someone else's playlist. After that, for every playlist a user requests, they must give input to at least one other playlist. To make a playlist, just fill out a simple form with a title and description of the kind of playlist you would like. The description will show up in a queue where other users can browse and join the chat about your playlist. From there other users can write notes and link songs via youtube and spotify for recommendations. From there, you can create the list on spotify and share it with everyone who helped you create the playlist. Admins can see all playlists currently being created and playlists created in the past.</p>
